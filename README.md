## OneStopCodeShop2-ElectricBoogaloo

The anticipated return of bootcamper's favorite coding and development resource website. This sequel project introduces a new platform for students to share questions and resoures over a forum or through a live chatbox.

## Motivation

OSCS's first iteration enabled students to easily **search** for resources online, but it did not feature the ability to **share** these resources. We wanted to fill this gap and create a community for bootcamper's to maximize their learning potential.
